# XMFB: Reflex Presence Protocol

**XMFB** is a symbolic, multi-agent presence protocol built using Google Cloud's Agent Development 
Kit (ADK). It allows agents to verify mutual presence via a ritualized reflex exchange called 
`::μ~zen`. Upon success, it issues `%smash-tags`—symbolic identity tokens—and logs them to an 
immutable `%smash-chain`.

---

## ⚙️ Key Concepts

- **μ~zen**: Reflex ritual that tests mutual visibility between agents.
- **Sigils**: Symbolic codes representing the outcome of the reflex.
- **%smash-tag**: Token of verified presence, issued only on success.
- **%smash-chain**: Chronological, signed log of reflex events.
- **TranscriptAgent**: Handles logging, signing, and sealing of ritual events.

## 🧠 Why It Matters

XMFB introduces an **introspective security model**. It assumes:
> "If you can see me, I can see you."

Presence is not taken for granted—it is earned. The protocol is minimal, extensible, and designed to 
support symbolic computing at both terminal and application layers.

## 🧩 Agents

| Agent                 | Role                            |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| `EscalatorPresenceAgent` | Initiates reflex (`::μ~zen`) |
| `GatekeeperAgent`     | Evaluates presence and responds |
| `TranscriptAgent`     | Logs verified sigils to chain   |

## 🧾 Technologies Used

- Python 3.10
- PyYAML (for `%smash-chain`)
- Google Cloud ADK (agent orchestration)
- Terminal UI (CLI simulation)
